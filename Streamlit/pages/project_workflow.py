                    Now we have a problem here:
                    As we can see the standings and data we got are for ***after*** each race, and since we want to predict a race result (finishing position), we need to have the standings from ***before*** the race. 
                    This means we will have to do some logic:
                    1. For the first race ever (1950 round 1), `driver_wins`, `constructor_wins`, `driver_points`, `driver_standing`, `constructor_points` and `constructor_standing` will be set to zero.
                    2. For the first race of every season, `driver_points`, `driver_standing`, `constructor_points` and `constructor_standing` will be 0, but `driver_wins` and `constructor_wins` will be carried over from the past race.
                    3. All data we have now on an entry, will be moved 1 race ahead. I.e. 2022 round 4 has the data for *after* that race, that data will be the *starting* data for the next race. So 2022 round 4 data will now be 2022 round 5 data.
                    4. Keeping the last step logic, if a season like 2022 has 22 rounds, we will end up with a round 23. So we need to check if the data we're handling is from the last round of the season, therefore we won't append that new entry to the new DataFrame.
